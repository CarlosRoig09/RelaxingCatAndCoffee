Relaxing Cat and Coffee was made during a Secret Santa Game Jam. The core idea of the game was three simple words:

- Pink.
- Cats.
- Coffee.

Giving this three keywords, I wanted to represent the peaceful environment of the color pink as a key core to the game. Just a simple, easy and relaxing game to play when you want. With this idea in mind and by researching, I found that the color pink in Japan represents a calm mind. So by that key idea, I wanted to make a game on a classic pink Japanese environment, the cherry blossoms. The cats and the coffee was the difficult part, but Cats and Japanese culture mix very well. Due to the short time period, I decided that the coffee tries to represent that relaxing pause before continue the job, recovering energy. 

To keep the game simple and relaxing, I was thinking about the slow fall of a blossom and center the game around that fact. The best way I thought to implement this idea was by a classic catching falling objects minigame. This is where I created the idea of a Cat pushing the blossoms with the use of wind and put it on the basket.
